When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    I think that there are a few main use-cases for a remote repository. The
    first is when working in a team. Using a remote repository is much more
    efficient in this scenario, because it allows multiple team members to
    collaborate at once. A hosting service like GitHub can make this extremely
    easy.

    Another use-case would be to back up a repository. If a computer becomes
    inaccessible or you accidentally deleted a local repository, a remote
    one can help immensely. By having a remote repository, code can be stored
    online instead of exclusively locally. If something does happen to your
    local repository, you can always revert back to the remote one.
