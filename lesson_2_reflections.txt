What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, the `.git` directory is created in the
    current repository. Essentially, this enables all of the Git functionality
    to be used within that repository. This is because it is the `.git`
    directory that houses the storage mechanism for the Git history. Without
    the `.git` directory, Git commands would not work because there would be
    no location to store the history.

    Additionally, initialization is especially important when collaborating.
    Git functionality is very valuable when working together because it
    shows clear changes between versions, which ensures quality code. Git
    repositories can also be shared on websites like GitHub, enabling for
    easier communication and collaboration. initialization is required for
    these benefits.
