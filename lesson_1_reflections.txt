How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff between different versions of a file enables you to see what
    was changed. If you know that a bug was introduced in the newest version,
    using a diff can make it much easier to catch the bug. This is because
    you know that a change shown by the diff causes the bug, so instead of
    searching through all of the code for a bug, you only have to check the
    new code in the diff.

    For example, if I add a bug in the newest version of file and commit it,
    someone else could check the diff between my diff and the one before it
    in order to find possible causes. This can speed up the development
    process.
